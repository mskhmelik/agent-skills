# /diagnose

## Overview

A disciplined loop for diagnosing bugs and regressions: build a deterministic
pass/fail feedback loop *first*, then hypothesise, instrument one variable at a
time, fix, and lock in a regression test. The discipline — feedback loop before
any fix or instrumentation — is the point; it stops blind guessing on hard bugs.
Sits at the start of bug work and hands off to `/tdd` for the RED→GREEN regression loop.

## When to Use

- **Use when:** the user types `/diagnose`, says "debug this" / "diagnose this",
  reports a bug, or something is broken/failing.
- **Best after:** you can read `docs/README.md`, `docs/prd.md` scope, and any
  `docs/adr/` for the affected module (read these before exploring code).
- **Do NOT use when:** you are implementing a known-good change from an issue (use
  `/tdd`), or the task is a refactor/feature with no failure to reproduce.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` may be a symptom description, an area/module, or empty. If empty, ask the
user for the symptom and how to reproduce it before starting Phase 1.

Before exploring code, read `docs/README.md` (if present), the `docs/prd.md` scope for
the area, and any `docs/adr/` touching the module. Do not expand scope beyond the PRD
without asking. See also central rule: `rules/debugging.md`.

## Process

Hard bugs need a **pass/fail feedback loop** before fixes or instrumentation. Skip
phases only when explicitly justified to the user.

### Phase 1 — Build a feedback loop (spend most effort here)

If you have a fast, deterministic, agent-runnable signal, the bug is mostly solved.
Without one, do not guess.

**Loop options — try in order. Flutter / Dart projects:**

1. **Failing widget test** at the seam the user hit (same presentation: mobile sheet
   vs desktop panel, same route).
2. **Failing unit test** on pure logic (parsers, mappers, keyboard handlers) — only if
   the bug is not focus/gesture/layout.
3. **`flutter test path/to/test.dart`** with minimal repro.
4. **Structured manual QA script** — `docs/manual_qa*.md` checklist; user runs steps,
   reports pass/fail per line.
5. **Replay** — captured log, HAR, or DB row through an isolated harness.

**Other stacks:** failing test → HTTP script → CLI fixture → headless browser → HITL
checklist (last resort).

**Flutter-specific:**

- Read the **event/focus graph** before instrumenting: `FocusNode` listeners,
  `onPointerDown`, `onKeyEvent`, parent `HardwareKeyboard`, `setState` gates.
- Match **presentation mode** in tests (`TransactionFormPresentation.panel` vs `.sheet`).
- Use **`/tdd` Step 0 (bug-fix mode)** to turn the loop into a regression test after the fix.

**When you cannot build a loop:** stop. List what you tried. Ask for (a) environment
access, (b) a captured artifact, or (c) permission for temporary tagged logs. **Do not
hypothesise blind.**

### Phase 2 — Reproduce

Run the loop. Confirm:

- [ ] Same failure mode the **user** described
- [ ] Reproducible (or high enough rate for flaky bugs)
- [ ] Exact symptom captured for verification later

### Phase 3 — Hypothesise

Generate **3–5 ranked, falsifiable** hypotheses before testing:

> If **H** is the cause, then **action** will make the bug disappear / worsen.

**Show the list to the user** before testing (unless AFK).

### Phase 4 — Instrument

One variable at a time. Each probe maps to one hypothesis.

1. Debugger / test inspection if available.
2. **Targeted logs** at boundaries — tag every line: `[DEBUG-a4f2]` (grep to clean up).
3. Never log everything.

**Flutter:** use project `AppLog.debug('a4f2', ...)` if present; otherwise
`debugPrint('[DEBUG-a4f2] ...')`. **No session-scoped log files** (no
`.cursor/debug-*.log`, no ad-hoc `agent_debug_log.dart`).

### Phase 5 — Fix + regression test

**Regression test before fix** when a **correct seam** exists (test exercises the real
bug pattern at the call site). If no correct seam: document that as the finding; consider
`docs/adr/`.

1. Failing test at seam → RED.
2. Minimal fix → GREEN.
3. Re-run the Phase 1 loop on the full scenario.

Hand off to **`/tdd`** for the RED→GREEN loop when appropriate.

### Phase 6 — Cleanup + post-mortem

- [ ] Original repro gone.
- [ ] Regression test passes (or seam gap documented).
- [ ] All `[DEBUG-...]` removed.
- [ ] Correct hypothesis noted in commit/PR message.

Ask: **What would have prevented this?** (missing test, missing doc, wrong seam, scope
drift from PRD).

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I can see the bug in the code — skip reproduction." | Reading code confirms a *theory*, not the failure. Without Phase 2 you cannot prove the fix worked. Build the loop. |
| "A unit test passes, so it's fixed." | If the report is widget/focus/keyboard, a passing unit test proves nothing at the seam the user hit. Reproduce at the same presentation. |
| "Let me add a few logs first to see what's happening." | Instrumenting before a Phase 1 loop exists is blind guessing. The loop comes first. |
| "It's an obvious one-line fix, no regression test needed." | If `flutter test` can reach the bug, a missing test means it recurs. RED before GREEN. |
| "This touches an extra module — I'll just fix it while I'm here." | Scope beyond `docs/prd.md` needs the user's OK. Note it; don't expand silently. |
| "I'll leave the debug logs, they might help later." | Tagged `[DEBUG-...]` lines are noise in the diff. Grep and remove every one in Phase 6. |

## Red Flags

- About to instrument or fix before a Phase 1 feedback loop exists.
- Hypothesising with no reproduction — no confirmed failing signal.
- Declaring "done" on unit tests when the report is widget/focus/keyboard.
- Changing more than one variable per probe; can't tell which change mattered.
- Writing session-scoped log files (`.cursor/debug-*.log`, `agent_debug_log.dart`).
- Editing files outside the PRD scope without asking.
- `[DEBUG-...]` lines still present in the final diff.

## Verification

- [ ] Phase 1 loop is deterministic and agent-runnable (command / test path recorded).
- [ ] Reproduction confirmed: matched the user's failure mode (Phase 2 output captured).
- [ ] Regression test added at the correct seam, observed failing THEN passing
      (RED→GREEN test output) — or the seam gap is documented in `docs/adr/`.
- [ ] Original repro no longer fires when the loop is re-run on the full scenario.
- [ ] Cleanup done: no `[DEBUG-...]` lines and no session log files remain (grep clean).
- [ ] Correct hypothesis + prevention note recorded in commit/PR message.

## Phase 7 — Feedback (always run last)

**Gate — do not begin this step until the deliverable is already visible in chat.** The
message that delivers this skill's output (report, saved paths, handoff block, summary)
must END with that output — no tool call after it. Ask for feedback in your NEXT message,
never in the same message as the deliverable and never before it.

Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "How did this skill perform?" — Header "Feedback"
> - "+1 — worked well"
> - "-1 — something went wrong"

On `-1`, ask a follow-up text question: "What went wrong?" (optional — Enter to skip).

Append one line to `feedback.jsonl` **in the same directory as this SKILL.md**:
`{"ts":"<ISO8601>","rating":<-1|1>,"comment":<string|null>}`

On `-1`: self-anneal — diagnose the root cause and **propose** the SKILL.md edit to the
user; apply it only after they approve. Never silently modify this file mid-session.
