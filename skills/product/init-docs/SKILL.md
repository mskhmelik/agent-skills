# /init-docs

## Overview

Scaffolds the **standard `docs/` layout** for a repo — the workflow README (two-lane
flow + mermaid), the OVERVIEW.md and DICTIONARY.md stubs (the only human-readable
product docs), and ADR/agents folders — copied from this skill's bundled `templates/`.
It exists so the interview → spec → tickets → TDD pipeline shares one predictable file
layout. Run it **first**, before `/ask-about-problems` or `/ask-about-solutions` (which
write into the files it creates). Specs and tickets live on GitHub, not in docs/.

Downstream consumers of this layout: `/ask-about-problems`, `/ask-about-solutions`,
`/to-spec`, `/to-tickets`, `/tdd`, `/review-code`, `/diagnose`, `/unslop-repo`.

## When to Use

- **Use when:** the user types `/init-docs`, says "init docs", "set up docs folder", or
  starts a new repo and needs the standard documentation layout.
- **Best after:** nothing — this is the first step in the product workflow.
- **Do NOT use when:** `docs/README.md` already describes this workflow (offer skip/merge
  instead), or the user wants to *fill in* content — that is `/ask-about-problems` and
  `/ask-about-solutions`, not this skill (templates are placeholders only).

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` may be an optional project title used to replace `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` in
templates. If empty, default to the repo folder name; ask only if ambiguous.

---

## Steps

### Step 0 — Resolve repository root

1. Start from the current working directory (or workspace root).
2. Walk upward until you find **`.git`**. That directory is **`REPO_ROOT`**.
3. If no git root, ask the user which folder is the project root.

All paths below are under `REPO_ROOT`.

### Step 1 — Explore existing docs

List what already exists under `docs/` (`docs/foundation/OVERVIEW.md`, legacy
`problem-summary.md`/`solution-overview.md`/`prd.md`/`CONTEXT.md`, etc.). If
`docs/README.md` already exists and describes this workflow, ask whether to **skip**,
**merge**, or **overwrite templates only**. If legacy files exist, offer to note them as
superseded — never delete them yourself.

### Step 2 — Confirm with user

Ask once (unless the user said "just scaffold"):

> "I'll create the standard docs/ layout (OVERVIEW + DICTIONARY + ADRs + workflow
> README). Overwrite empty templates only, or also refresh README?"

Default: create missing files; **do not overwrite** a non-empty
`foundation/OVERVIEW.md` or `foundation/DICTIONARY.md`.

### Step 3 — Scaffold

Create directories if missing, then copy from this skill's `templates/` directory:

```
docs/
├── README.md                     ← workflow hub: two-lane flow + mermaid + closed-layout contract (templates/template-readme.md)
├── foundation/
│   ├── OVERVIEW.md               ← THE human-readable doc: problem → system idea & components → workflows → decisions (templates/template-overview.md)
│   └── DICTIONARY.md             ← canonical domain terms (templates/template-dictionary.md)
├── reviews/
│   └── adr/
│       └── README.md             ← when to write ADRs (templates/template-adr-readme.md)
└── agents/
    └── README.md                 ← optional per-repo agent pointers (templates/template-agents-readme.md)
```

`engineering/{loops,modules,security,ops}` are homes agents may extend into later
(module deep dives, `/afk-dev` loop logs, security notes, build/tooling docs) — not
scaffolded up front since they start empty. **Specs and tickets are GitHub issues**
(`/to-spec`, `/to-tickets`) — they never get repo files.

| Output | Template file |
|--------|---------------|
| `docs/README.md` | `template-readme.md` |
| `docs/foundation/OVERVIEW.md` | `template-overview.md` |
| `docs/foundation/DICTIONARY.md` | `template-dictionary.md` |
| `docs/reviews/adr/README.md` | `template-adr-readme.md` |
| `docs/agents/README.md` | `template-agents-readme.md` |
| `AGENTS.md` (optional, repo root) | `template-agents.md` |

Replace `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with the repo folder name or user-provided title. OVERVIEW.md
is filled by `/ask-about-problems` (Problem) and `/ask-about-solutions` (the rest);
DICTIONARY.md by `/ask-about-solutions`.

### Step 4 — Repo pointer (optional)

If **`AGENTS.md`** is missing at repo root, offer to create a minimal stub from
`templates/template-agents.md` pointing to `docs/README.md` (product workflow), the shared skills
directory (slash commands), and the shared rules directory (debugging/docs rules).

### Step 5 — Report

Tell the user:

1. What was created vs skipped (already existed).
2. **Next steps (feature lane):** `/ask-about-problems` → `/ask-about-solutions` (writes
   `DICTIONARY.md`) → `/to-spec` (spec issue) → `/to-tickets` → `/tdd` → `/review-code`.
3. **Maintenance lane** (bugs, QA findings on shipped behavior): `/diagnose` →
   `/create-ticket` — no spec ceremony.

## Hard rules

| Rule | Why / violation looks like |
|---|---|
| Never write under a directory you haven't confirmed as `REPO_ROOT` (Step 0). | Guessing scatters `docs/` into the wrong folder — ask the user. |
| Copy from `templates/`; never improvise structure or type content by hand. | The layout must match what downstream skills expect. |
| Templates are placeholders — never fill them with real product content. | That content is owned by `/ask-about-problems` and `/ask-about-solutions`; inventing it corrupts their inputs. |
| Never overwrite a non-empty `foundation/OVERVIEW.md` or `foundation/DICTIONARY.md` without explicit consent (Step 2); never delete legacy docs yourself. | Silent overwrite destroys prior work; clobbering a customized README needs the Step 1 skip/merge/overwrite ask. |
| Replace every `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` in created files. | A leftover placeholder ships broken docs. |
| **Docs write-scope.** Create or write docs only at the canonical paths in the docs layout contract (`docs/README.md`): `foundation/`, `reviews/` (+`adr/`), `engineering/{loops,modules,security,ops}`, `agents/`. Never create a new top-level doc folder, a loose file at `docs/` root, or a `-vN` filename variant. Findings and backlog go to GitHub issues via `/create-ticket`, never to a new doc. If nothing fits, ask — do not invent a path. | Scattering files outside the closed layout breaks every downstream skill that reads from fixed paths. |

## Verification

- [ ] `REPO_ROOT` was resolved (a `.git` directory found, or confirmed by the user).
- [ ] `docs/README.md`, `docs/foundation/OVERVIEW.md`, and `docs/foundation/DICTIONARY.md`
  exist (created or pre-existing and preserved).
- [ ] `docs/reviews/adr/README.md` and `docs/agents/README.md` exist.
- [ ] No `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` placeholder remains in any newly written file
  (e.g. `grep -r '{{PROJECT_NAME}}' docs/` returns nothing).
- [ ] No pre-existing non-empty file was overwritten without consent.
- [ ] The report lists created-vs-skipped files and the next-step sequence.

## Step 6 — Feedback (always run last)

**Gate — write the full deliverable as text FIRST, then ask for feedback in the same
response.** The bug this prevents: calling `AskUserQuestion` before the deliverable is
written, so the user sees the feedback prompt first and the output only after replying.
Emit the complete deliverable (report, saved paths, summary) as text, then call
`AskUserQuestion` — never before the deliverable text, and never with another tool call
between them.

Then use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "How did this skill perform?" — Header "Feedback"
> - "+1 — worked well"
> - "-1 — something went wrong"

On `-1`, ask a follow-up text question: "What went wrong?" (optional — Enter to skip).

Append one line to `feedback.jsonl` **in the same directory as this SKILL.md**:
`{"ts":"<ISO8601>","rating":<-1|1>,"comment":<string|null>}`

On `-1`: self-anneal — diagnose the root cause and **propose** the SKILL.md edit to the
user; apply it only after they approve. Never silently modify this file mid-session.
